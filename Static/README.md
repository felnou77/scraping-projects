# 🧾 Static Web Scraping Projects

This folder contains a collection of simple static web scraping projects built to practice HTML parsing, data extraction, and file export using Python.

These sites do not require JavaScript rendering, which makes them ideal for learning with tools like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.

Static websites serve content that is already present in the HTML when the page loads. Scraping these sites is straightforward — you can fetch the page using tools like requests and parse it with BeautifulSoup.
